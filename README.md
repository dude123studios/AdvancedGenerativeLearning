# Generative Models!
These are examples of GAN/VAE architectures, some of which are from the book: "Hands-On Image Generation with Tensorflow"
This includes:
Image -> Image Translation techniques like:
  - Pix2Pix (Supervised)
  - GauGAN (Supervised, but MultiModel, For Segmentation Masks)
  - CycleGAN (Unsupervised)
  - BicycleGAN (Supervised, MultiModel, Any paired dataset)
  - StarGAN (Unsupervised, MultiDomain)

Stylization techniques like: 
  - Nueral Style Transfer
  - Arbitrary Style Transfer

High Fidelity Techniques:
  - PgGAN (High Res, very slow and lower quality)
  - StyleGAN (High Res, very high quality, quite slow)

Wide Range Techniques:
  - SelfAttention GAN (Low Res)
  - BigGAN (High Res)
